# Retrieve the empty list when there are no archive policies.
# NOTE(chdent): This demonstrates what used to be considered a
# security bug in JSON output:
# http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/security/#json-security
# The version described there is supposed to be fixed in most modern
# browsers but there is a new version of the problem which is only
# fixed in some:
# http://haacked.com/archive/2009/06/25/json-hijacking.aspx/
# The caveats point out that this is only an issue if your data is
# sensitive, which in this case...?
# However, the api-wg has made it recommedation that collections
# be returned as an object with a named key with a value of a list
# as follows: {"archive_policies": [...]}
# This allows for extensibility such as future support for pagination.
# Do we care?
