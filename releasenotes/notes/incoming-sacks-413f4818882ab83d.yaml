    The storage driver needs to be upgraded. The number of sacks to distribute
    across can be configured on upgrade by passing in ``sacks-number``
    value on upgrade. A default number of sacks will be created if not set.
    This can be reconfigured post-upgrade as well by using
    ``gnocchi-change-sack-size`` cli. See documentation for hints on the number
    of sacks to set for your environment and upgrade notes
