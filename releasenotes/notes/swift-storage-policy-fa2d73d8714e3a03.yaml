    The Swift storage driver can now be configured to create containers
    with a custom storage policy using the ``swift_storage_policy``
    option. This allows for overriding the storage policy when using
    the default policy is not desirable, e.g. to limit object replication
    to a single region when multi-region replication is the default.
