    Gnocchi now strictly respects the archive policy configured timespan when
    storing aggregates. Before, it could keep up to the number of points
    defined in the archive policy, keeping more than the configured timespan.
    The timespan duration is now strictly respected. Gnocchi only keeps the
    points between the last aggregated timestamp and the last aggregated
    timestamp minus the duration of the archive policy timespan.
