    Support added to accept GET requests to /v1/batch/metrics/measures to
    retrieve multiple metrics in a single request. Metric ids should be passed
    in as query parameters in the format
    /v1/batch/metrics/measures?metric=uuid1&metric=uuid2. Additionally,
    ``start``, ``stop``, ``granularity`` and ``aggregation`` parameters may be
    passed in for additional filtering. All metrics must support the same
    granularity and aggregation if filtering on those attributes.
