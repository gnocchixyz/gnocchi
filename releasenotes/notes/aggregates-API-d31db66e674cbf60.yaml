    New API endpoint allows to retrieve, transform, aggregates measurements on the
    fly in an flexible way. The endpoint location is `/v1/aggregates`.
    This endpoint allows to describe `operations` to be done on a metrics list.
    Example: `(* 5  (rolling mean 3 (aggregate sum (metric (metric1 mean)
    (metric2 mean)))))`. The metrics list can be retrieved by searching in
    resources by setting 'resource_type' and 'search'. More details are
    available in the documentation.
