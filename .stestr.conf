# The group_regex describes how stestr will group tests into the same process
# when running concurently. The following ensures that gabbi tests coming from
# the same YAML file are all in the same process. This is important because
# each YAML file represents an ordered sequence of HTTP requests. Note that
# tests which do not match this regex will not be grouped in any special way.
# See the following for more details.
