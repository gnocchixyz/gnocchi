 REST API Usage
================

Authentication
==============

By default, the `api.middleware` configuration option is set to use the
Keystone middleware. Therefore you must authenticate using Keystone to use the
API and provide an `X-Auth-Token` header with a valid token for each request
sent to Gnocchi.

Metrics
=======

Gnocchi provides a resource type that is called *metric*. A metric designates
any thing that can be measured: the CPU usage of a server, the temperature of a
room or the number of bytes sent by a network interface.

A metric only has a few properties: a UUID to identify it, and the archive
policy that will be used to store and aggregate the measures.

To create a metric, the following API request should be used:

{{ scenarios['create-metric']['doc'] }}

Once created, you can retrieve the metric information:

{{ scenarios['get-metric']['doc'] }}

You can retrieve the archive policy definitions by adding a *details* parameter
to this request:

{{ scenarios['get-metric-details']['doc'] }}

It is also possible to send the *details* parameter in the *Accept* header:

{{ scenarios['get-metric-details-in-accept']['doc'] }}

To retrieve the list of all the metrics created, use the following request:

{{ scenarios['list-metric']['doc'] }}

It is possible to send measures to the metric:

{{ scenarios['post-measures']['doc'] }}

If there are no errors, Gnocchi does not return a response body, only a simple
status code. It is possible to provide any number of measures.

.. IMPORTANT::

   While it is possible to send any number of (timestamp, value), it is still
   needed to honor constraints defined by the archive policy used by the metric,
   such as the maximum timespan.


Once measures are sent, it is possible to retrieve them using *GET* on the same
endpoint:

{{ scenarios['get-measures']['doc'] }}

The list of points returned is composed of tuples with (timestamp, granularity,
value) sorted by timestamp. The granularity is the timespan covered by
aggregation for this point.

It is possible to filter the measures over a time range by specifying the
*start* and/or *stop* parameters to the query with timestamp. The timestamp
format can be either a floating number (UNIX epoch) or an ISO8601 formated
timestamp:

{{ scenarios['get-measures-from']['doc'] }}

By default, the aggregated values that are returned use the *mean* aggregation
method. It is possible to request for any other method by specifying the
*aggregation* query parameter:

{{ scenarios['get-measures-max']['doc'] }}

The list of aggregation method available is: *mean*, *sum*, *last*, *max*,
*min*, *std*, *median*, *count* and *first*.

Archive Policy
==============

When sending measures for a metric to Gnocchi, the values are dynamically
aggregated. That means that Gnocchi does not store all sent measures, but
aggregates them over a certain period of time. Gnocchi provides several
aggregation methods (mean, min, max, sum…) that are builtin.

An archive policy is defined by a list of items in the `definition` field. Each
item is composed of the timespan and the level of precision that must be kept
when aggregating data, determined using at least 2 of the `points`,
`granularity` and `timespan` fields. For example, an item might be defined
as 12 points over 1 hour (one point every 5 minutes), or 1 point every 1 hour
over 1 day (24 points).

By default, new measures can only be processed if they have timestamps in the
future or part of the last aggregation period. The window size is based on the
largest granularity defined in the archive policy definition. To enlarge this
window size, the `back_window` field can be used to set the number of periods
to keep so it is possible to process measures that are older than the last
timestamp period boundary.

For example, if an archive policy is defined with coarsest aggregation of 1
hour, and the last point processed has a timestamp of 14:34, it's possible to
process measures back to 14:00 with a `back_window` of 0. If the `back_window`
is set to 2, it will be possible to send measures with timestamp back to 12:00.

The REST API allows to create archive policies this way:

{{ scenarios['create-archive-policy']['doc'] }}

By default, all aggregation methods are computed and store, but it is possible
to limit the aggregation methods used in an archive policy by sepcifying the
list of aggregation method to use in the `aggregation_methods` attribute of an
archive policy.

{{ scenarios['create-archive-policy-without-max']['doc'] }}

The list of aggregation methods can the list the methods, or a list of methods
to not use by prefixing them by `-` (minus).

Once the archive policy is created, the complete set of properties is computed
and returned, with the URL of the archive policy. This URL can be used to
retrieve the details of the archive policy later:

{{ scenarios['get-archive-policy']['doc'] }}

It is also possible to list archive policies:

{{ scenarios['list-archive-policy']['doc'] }}

It is possible to delete an archive policy if it is not used by any metric:

{{ scenarios['delete-archive-policy']['doc'] }}

Resources
=========

Gnocchi provides the ability to store and index resources. Each resource has a
type. The basic type of resources is *generic*, but more specialized subtypes
also exist, especially to describe OpenStack resources.

The REST API allows to manipulate resources. To create a generic resource:

{{ scenarios['create-resource-generic']['doc'] }}

The *id*, *user_id* and *project_id* attributes must be UUID and are mandatory.
The timestamp describing the lifespan of the resource are not, and *started_at*
is by default set to the current timestamp.

It's possible to retrieve the resource by the URL provided in the `Location`
header.

More specialized resources can be created. For example, the *instance* is used
to describe an OpenStack instance as managed by Nova_.

{{ scenarios['create-resource-instance']['doc'] }}

All specialized types have their own optional and mandatory attributes,
but they all include attributes from the generic type as well.

To retrieve a resource by its URL provided by the `Location` header at creation
time:

{{ scenarios['get-resource-generic']['doc'] }}

It's possible to modify a resource by re-uploading it partially with the
modified fields:

{{ scenarios['patch-resource']['doc'] }}

It possible to delete a resource altogether:

{{ scenarios['delete-resource-generic']['doc'] }}

All resources can be listed, either by using the `generic` type that will list
all types of resources, or by filtering on their resource type:

{{ scenarios['list-resource-generic']['doc'] }}

No attributes specific to the resource type are retrieved when using the
`generic` endpoint. To retrieve the details, either list using the specific
resource type endpoint:

{{ scenarios['list-resource-instance']['doc'] }}

or using `details=true` in the query parameter:

{{ scenarios['list-resource-generic-details']['doc'] }}

When listing resources, it is possible to filter resource based on attributes
values:

{{ scenarios['get-resource-for-user']['doc'] }}

Each resource can be linked to any number of metrics. The `metrics` attributes
is a key/value field where the key is the name of the relationship and
the value is a metric:

{{ scenarios['create-resource-instance-with-metrics']['doc'] }}

It's also possible to create metrics dynamically while creating a resource:

{{ scenarios['create-resource-instance-with-dynamic-metrics']['doc'] }}

The metric associated with a resource an be accessed and manipulated using the
usual `/v1/metric` endpoint or using the named relationship with the resource:

{{ scenarios['get-resource-named-metrics-measures']['doc'] }}

The same endpoint can be used to append metrics to a resource:

{{ scenarios['append-metrics-to-resource']['doc'] }}

Aggregation across metrics
==========================

Gnocchi allows to do on-the-fly aggregation of already aggregated data of
metrics. This can be done by filtering on resource attributes like this:

{{ scenarios['get-across-metrics-measures-by-attributes-lookup']['doc'] }}

It can also be done by providing the list of metrics to aggregate:

{{ scenarios['get-across-metrics-measures-by-metric-ids']['doc'] }}

.. Note::

   This aggregation is done against the aggregates built and updated for
   a metric when new measurements are posted in Gnocchi. Therefore the aggregate
   of this already aggregated data may not have sense for certain kind of
   aggregation method (e.g. stdev).


Capabilities
============

The list aggregation methods that can be used in Gnocchi is extendable and
can differ between deployement. It is possible to get the supported list of
aggregation methods from the API server:

{{ scenarios['get-capabilities']['doc'] }}

Timestamp format
================

Timestamps used in Gnocchi are always returned using the ISO 8601 format.
Gnocchi is able to understand a few formats of timestamp when querying or
creating resources, for example

- "2014-01-01 12:12:34" or "2014-05-20T10:00:45.856219", ISO 8601 timestamps.
- "10 minutes", which means "10 minutes from now".
- "-2 days", which means "2 days ago".
- 1421767030, a Unix epoch based timestamp.
