===================
Statsd Daemon Usage
===================

What Is It?
===========
`Statsd`_ is a network daemon that listens for statistics sent over the network
using TCP or UDP, and then sends |aggregates| to another backend.

Gnocchi provides a daemon that is compatible with the statsd protocol and can
listen to |metrics| sent over the network, named `gnocchi-statsd`.

How It Works?
=============
In order to enable statsd support in Gnocchi, you need to configure the
`[statsd]` option group in the configuration file. You need to provide a
|resource| ID that will be used as the main generic |resource| where all the
|metrics| will be attached, a user and project id that will be associated with
the |resource| and |metrics|, and an |archive policy| name that will be used to
create the |metrics|.

All the |metrics| will be created dynamically as the |metrics| are sent to
`gnocchi-statsd`, and attached with the provided name to the |resource| ID you
configured.

The `gnocchi-statsd` may be scaled, but trade-offs have to been made due to the
nature of the statsd protocol. That means that if you use |metrics| of type
`counter`_ or sampling (`c` in the protocol), you should always send those
|metrics| to the same daemon â€“ or not use them at all. The other supported
types (`timing`_ and `gauges`_) does not suffer this limitation, but be aware
that you might have more |measures| that expected if you send the same |metric|
to different `gnocchi-statsd` server, as their cache nor their flush delay are
synchronized.

.. note ::
   The statsd protocol support is incomplete: relative gauge values with +/-
   and sets are not supported yet.
